#1.2.4 Exponentiation
## Problem
Consider the problem of computing the exponential of a given number. We would like a procedure that takes as arguments a base b and a posi- tive integer exponent n and computes bn . One way to do this is via the recursive definition：  	bn =b·bn−1, 	b0 =1,which translates readily into the procedure
## Recursive Procedure
```
(define (exp a n)
  (if(= n 0)
    1
    (* (exp a (- n 1)) a)))```### Running time

```(exp 2 4)
(* (exp 2 3) 2)
(* (* (exp 2 2) 2) 2)
(* (* (* (exp 2 1) 2) 2) 2)
(* (* (* (* (exp 2 0) 2) 2) 2) 2)
(* (* (* (* 1 2) 2) 2) 2)
(* (* (* 2 2) 2) 2)
(* (* 4 2) 2)
(* 8 2)
(16)
```
- order of growth in space:  **theta(n)**  
- order of growther of time: **theta(n)**

## Iterative Procedure

```
(define (exp a n)
  (define (expi a n product)
    (if(= n 0)
      product
      (expi a (- n 1) (* product a))))
  (expi a n 1))
```

``` 
(exp 2 4)
(expi 2 4 1)
(expi 2 3 2)
(expi 2 2 4)
(expi 2 1 8)
(expi 2 0 16)
(16) 
``` 
- order of growth in space: **theta(1)**  
- order of growth of time: **theta(n)**

##Improved Imponentiation algorithem
The Imponentiation can be improved as below:

b^n = (b^(n/2))^2     ----if n is even,   
b^n = (b^(n-1))b      ----if n is odd.
