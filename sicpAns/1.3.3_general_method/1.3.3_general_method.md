### use fixed-point method to find quare root.
suppose we have y = x^2, then we call x as suqare root of number y
if we change the equation of:  
  y = x^2
to:
  x = y/x
then we find that x(the square root of y) is a fixed point of function f(x) = y/x
Here we have a guess vibricating issue: 
suppose we have an initial guess x1, then
x2=y/x1
x3=y/x2=y/(y/x1) = x1
which means the guess value is vibricating between x1 and x2 and never end.
so we need to use an alternative x=(x+(y/x))/2 which meets:  
 - the equation is same as before
 - guess will converge step by step.

### Exercise 1.38: 
In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De Fractionibus Continuis, which included a continued fraction expansion for e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the Ni are all 1, and the Di are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1,
6, 1, 1, 8,... Write a program that uses your cont-frac procedure from Exercise 1.37 to approximate e, based on Eulerâ€™s expansion.

```
(define (k-term-finite-continue-fraction n d k) 
  (define (frac-iter i result)
   ; (newline) (display result) (newline)
    (if(< i 1) 
	  result
	  (frac-iter (- i 1) (/ (n i) (+ (d i) result)))))
  (frac-iter k 0.0))

(define (D k) 
  (if(= 2 (remainder k 3))
    (expt 2 (truncate (/ k 3)))
	1))
(define (e k)
  (+ 2 
     (k-term-finite-continue-fraction 
	   (lambda (i) 1) 
	   d
	   k)))

### Exercise 1.39: 
A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:

```
tan(x) = x/(1 - (x^2/(3 - (x^2/(5 - (x^2/(7 - (...)))))))  
-> (-x)tan(x) = (-x^2)/(1 + ((-x^2)/(3 + ((-x^2)/(5 + (...))))))  
-> tan(x) = (/ (k-term-finite-continue-fraction n d k) (-x))
where,
   n(i) = -x^2
   d(i) = 2*i -1;
```
**procedure**
```
(define (tan-cf1 x k)
  (/ (k-term-finite-continue-fraction
       (lambda (k) (- (* x x)))
       (lambda (k) (- (* 2 k) 1))
       k)
     (- x)))
	 
(tan-cf1 (/ 3.14 4) 10) = 0.9992039901050428
