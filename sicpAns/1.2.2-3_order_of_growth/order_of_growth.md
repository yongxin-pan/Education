# Order of Growth

## Exercise 1.15
The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x ≈ x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity:  
    sin(x) = 3sin(x/3) − 4(sin(x/3))^3
### Procedures

```   
(define (cube x) (* x x x))(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x)))) (define (sine angle)   (if(not (> (abs angle) 0.1))      angle     (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

```

### Questions
a. How many times is the procedure p applied when(sine12.15) is evaluated?
b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?
### Answer
- **Answer A**:   1. (sine 12.15) -> (p (sine (4.05)))  2. (sine 4.05)  -> (p (sine (1.35)))
  3. (sine 1.35)  -> (p (sine (0.45)))
  4. (sine 0.45)  -> (p (sine (0.15)))
  5. (sine 0.15)  -> (p (sine (0.05)))
  6. (sine 0.05)  -> (0.05)  
  
when step 6 is computed, procedure **sine** found it equals to angle(**value: 0.05**) directly. So procedure **p** is calculated **5 times** while procedure **sine** is calculated **6 times**.

- **Answer B**:
  a. Order of growth in space.  
     **sine** procedure is a linear recursive procedure (linear recursive procedure is theta(n) as regarding to order of growth in space). Further more, the order of growth of n is dividend by 3 times. So, **sine** procedure can be considered as **theta(log(n))** in space.
  b. Order of growth of steps  
    **steps = theta(log(n))** as the since procedure is **a linear recursive procedure** and **the question itself goes down 3 times each iteration**.
