# 1.3.2 Constructing procedures with lambda

lambda is anonymous procedure which can significantly improve the code concision.


### example usages


```
;# refactoring product-of-prime-integers-to-n in exercise 1.3.3
(define (product-of-prime-integers-to-n n)
  (accumulate-filter
    (lambda (x y) (* x y))
    1
    (lambda (x) x)
    1
    n
    (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
    (lambda (x) (= 1 (gcd x n)))))	

;# refactoring pi-sum procedure
(define (sum a b term next)
  (if(> a b)
    0
    (+ (term a) (sum (next a) b term next))))
    
(define (pi-sum a b)  (sum a b    (lambda (x) (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))    (lambda (x) (+ x 4))))  
```

## Let syntax and its usage
**let** is used to define local variable which can significantly reduce the size of procedure definition.

### syntax

	(let (
		(var1 exp1) 
		(var2 exp2)
	    ...
	    (varn expn)) 
	  body)
which can be expressed as below:

    (let (<var1> have the value <exp1> and
          <var2> have the value <exp2> and
          ......
          <varn> have the value <expn> )
      in <body>)

For example: 

	(define (f x y)
	  (let ( (a (+ 1 (* x y)))
	         (b (- 1 y)))
	    (+ (* x (square a))
	       (* y b)
	       (* a b))))

### Note
- local variables defined in let is only available in its body and other than that it is not accessible.
For example, f procedure is defined as below:

```
	(define (f x) 
	  (+ (let ((x 3))
	       (+ x (* x 10)))
	     x))
```	     
and if x is given 5 as the argument for procedure f, its result would be:

	(f 5) = (+ (+ 3 (* 3 10)) 5) = (+ 33 5) = 38

- variablesâ€™ values are computed outside the let but in body part. If there are two local variables shared their variables in same let section, they will not be computed inline.

```
(define (f x y)
  (let ((x 3)
        (y (+ x 2)))
    (* x y)))
    
(f 2 2) = (* (3) (+ x 2)) = (* 3 (+ 2 2)) = (* 3 4) = 12    
```

## Exercise 1.34 procedure as argument

```
   (define (f g) (g 2));#then we have   (f square) = 4   (f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1)))) = 6
```
What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to eval- uate the combination (f f)? 

**Result**: The object 2 is not applicable.  
**Explanation**:  
(f f) -> (* f 2) -> (2 2) and for  
(2 2) , the intepreter surely can not assess.
